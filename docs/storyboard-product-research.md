- Organizational tooling covering scene tags, story beats, and narrative arcs.
- Visual hierarchy and UX considerations optimized for tablet and desktop experiences.

## Deliverable
A structured report summarizing:
- Recommended feature enhancements and UI/UX patterns.
- References to industry-leading implementations (e.g., StudioBinder, Boords, Milanote).
- Practical suggestions for applying these ideas to StudioOrganize's storyboard experience.

## Status
